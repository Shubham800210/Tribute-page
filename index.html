                <h2>A Trailblazing Cricket Icon and Inspirational Leader</h2>
                <p> <b>Mahendra Singh Dhoni</b> born 7 July 1981 is an Indian professional cricketer. He was captain of
                    the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017 and in Test cricket from 2008 to
                    2014. Dhoni is widely considered one of the greatest cricket captains, wicket-keeper-batsman and
                    finishers in the history of cricket.[a] He plays as a right-handed wicket-keeper-batsman and is
                    known for his calm captaincy and his ability to finish matches in tight situations. He is also the
                    current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League.</p>
